    <p>I went to Munich in October 2021. I went there with the Croatian Rowing National Team for the European Junior
      Championships. We were accommodated in a hotel a bit outside of Munich because the
      racing course is located outside of the city. I was always skeptical about German food, but after
      trying it I was amazed. From the soft pretzels to the tasty sausages, there was always a variety of tasty
      foods. We also had unlimited food on the racing course which helped us fuel up for the races. After the
      competition was over we went to check out the Allianz Arena which was just enormous. Then we just drove through
      the town because we didn't have enough time to go sightseeing, but I was still amazed by the architecture and how
      the
      whole town is clean and in order. Nevertheless I would strongly recommend everyone to go and visit Munich one day.
