    <!--Paragraph-->
    <p>Welcome to my webpage about Munich, or as the locals call it, "München"! Munich is the capital of the Bavaria
      region
      in southern Germany and is known for its rich history, stunning architecture, vibrant culture, and world-famous
      Oktoberfest celebration. Whether you're interested in exploring museums and art galleries, experiencing
      traditional
      Bavarian cuisine, or simply taking a stroll through one of Munich's many beautiful parks, there is something for
      everyone in this bustling city. I am going to show you all that Munich has to offer and why it is one of the most
      loved destinations in Europe.</p>
