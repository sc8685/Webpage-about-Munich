    <!--Headers and paragraphs-->
    <h2>CRAP:</h2>
    <p>I think I did a decent job regarding the CRAP principles.
      The colors contrast with eachother but they are still pleasant for the viewer.
      Everything is aligned, there is a repetition of elements.
    </p>

    <h2>ORGANIZATION:</h2>
    <p>The pages are placed in categories and information
      on the pages is also separated so the reader doesn't have to look at big chunks
      of text.
    </p>

    <h2>CONTENT:</h2>
    <p>I personally think that the content is interesting to read and I'm pretty confident in my
      grammar and spelling skills.
    </p>

    <h2>NAVIGATION:</h2>
    <p>I think I did a good job with the navigation, the navbar is pretty clean and
      at it is always clear where you are at the current moment because every page has a labeled
      title.
    </p>

    <h2>HTML and CSS:</h2>
    <p>I used HTML and CSS to align everything and position it.</p>

    <h2>REFERENCE:</h2>
    <p>There is a separate page that has IEEE referencing for each image that is not mine (in order).</p>
