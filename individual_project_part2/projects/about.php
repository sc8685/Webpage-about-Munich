    <!--Headers and paragraphs-->
    <h2>Original JavaScript:</h2>
    <p>
        I created a "fade" js function. The function works in a way that when the
        user first opens or refreshes the page the content visible to him fades in
        from bottom to top. As the user scrolls down and reveals more content the content 
        fades in. The content that fades is: h1, h2, p and images. The js effect is present on all pages. 
    </p>

    <h2>DHTML:</h2>
    <p>
        I created a button that only reveals itself when the user scrolls down.
        The JavaScript works in a way that it returns the user to the top of the page.
        The button also utilizes css and it is present on all pages.
    </p>

    <h2>Extra 1:</h2>
    <p>The first extra I used is present on the homepage. It is a keyframes feature
        that "types in" the header and slides it from left to the right of the screen.
    </p>

    <h2>Extra 2:</h2>
    <p>
        The second extra I used is also present on the homepage. I used css
        transitions so when the user hovers over the image the image grows, and when the user removes the mouse
        the image shrinks back to it's normal size.
    </p>
