    <h1>History</h1>
    <p>The first Oktoberfest was held in Munich in 1810 to celebrate the marriage of
      Crown Prince Ludwig (later King Ludwig I) and Princess Therese of
      Saxony-Hildburghausen. The festival was so successful that it became an
      annual event, and over time it evolved into the celebration we know today.</p>

    <h1>Beer</h1>
    <p>The beer at Oktoberfest is brewed specifically for the festival and is served
      in large, one-liter steins known as Maßkrüge. The beer is typically
      a type of lager called Märzen, which has a rich, malty flavor and a deep
      amber color. There are six official breweries that supply beer to Oktoberfest:
      Augustiner, Hofbräu, Hacker-Pschorr, Löwenbräu, Paulaner, and Spaten.</p>

      Bavarian cuisine. Visitors can enjoy hearty dishes like Schweinshaxe
      (pork knuckle), Würstl (sausages), and Brezen (pretzels). There are also
      plenty of sweet treats available, including Apfelstrudel (apple strudel)
